## Getting Started

2. Fetch submodules `git submodule update --init`
3. Open `TwoFAuth.xcodeproj`

## Privacy Considerations

Your data never leaves your devices. If you enable iCloud Sync data will be transmitted to your private iCloud Database via CloudKit framework encrypted with AES256.

2FAuth uses [NTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) to get the current secure time . Feel free to use any traffic monitor (e.g., [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com)) to check it yourself.

All website favicons are bundled in the app. There's a standalone [internal tool](https://github.com/2FAuth/2FAuth-iOS/tree/main/TwoFAuthFavIconExporter) that uses https://twofactorauth.org database to fetch all websites supporting 2FA.

## Special thanks

This app would not have been possible without an awesome [OneTimePassword](https://github.com/mattrubin/OneTimePassword) library from Matt Rubin.
