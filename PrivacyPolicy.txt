2FAuth stores all your data locally on your device (or in encrypted form in Apple iCloud if it was enabled). 2FAuth does not collect or transfer any personal information.


CloudKit and iCloud

2FAuth may optionally use Apple CloudKit to sync data between your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch). Your data is stored in a private database, which is encrypted with an account-based key and additionally encrypted with a user-provided passphrase. Therefore, we do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. We also do not have access to your Apple ID.

Revoke access / Delete data: You can revoke access to iCloud and delete all your data in the iOS Settings app on your iOS device.
